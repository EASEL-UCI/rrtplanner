   .. py:method:: plan(self, xstart: numpy.ndarray, xgoal: numpy.ndarray)

      
      Compute a plan from `xstart` to `xgoal`. Using the RRT* Informed algorithm.

      Keep in mind: if the cost function does not correspond to the Euclidean cost,
      this algorithm may undersample the solution space -- therefore, for non R^2
      distance cost functions, it is recommended to use the RRT* algorithm instead.

      The plan is a tree, with the root at `xstart` and a leaf at `xgoal`. If xgoal
      could not be connected to the tree, the leaf nearest to xgoal is considered the
      "goal" leaf.

      :Parameters:

          **xstart** : np.ndarray
              (2, ) start point

          **xgoal** : np.ndarray
              (2, ) goal point

      :Returns:

          Tuple[nx.DiGraph, int]
              DiGraph of the tree, and the vertex of the goal leaf (if goal could be
              reached) or the closest tree node.
